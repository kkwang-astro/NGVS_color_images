# NGVS_color_images
Code and examples for generating galaxy color images in NGVS 

For scaling function here we use img_scale.py written by Min-Su Shin at KASI, which is freely distributed (Many thanks!).  

I would recommend to go through the galaxy catalog of NGVS, using their effective radius information to decide the output size of images. And we can also get some necessary information and display them on images (e.g. name, magnitude, effective radius galaxy type).
